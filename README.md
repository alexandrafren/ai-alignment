### Hello and welcome to the Advocacy Institute's Alignment Assignment!

#### About this repository

This repository serves as a coding challenge that our team refers to as an alignment assignment, because we're looking to assess the alignment between your skills and approach and our needs. The app itself is a simplified version of a React app we created to display data about elected officials and their staff across New York.

The app fetches data from our Rails API. You should have been given an API key and you can see how it can be stored in .env.sample. Please let us know if you haven't received this or have any questions.

In the project directory, you can run `npm install` to install the dependencies and `npm start` to run the app in development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### The Assignment

This assignment is intended to gather a sense of how you approach your work and possibly learn new skills or frameworks. It serves to showcase some of your technical and communication skills.

Please fork the repository and complete the following two items:

1. Refactor the app in some way. This can be in functionality, structure, implementation, visual layout, or anything else you feel is valuable. This is intentionally open ended, we want you to choose what is important and interesting to you.
2. Add a feature that allows users to see the Senate bill(s) sponsored by a given Senator.

   - Use the [NY Senate Open Legislation API](https://legislation.nysenate.gov/#/docs), specifically the New York State Bills and Resolutions API, as the data source.

   - Please add a feature to the existing Interactive Senate Display, as you see fit, to show users the bill(s) that a given Senator is sponsoring.

Feel welcome to communicate and collaborate with us throughout the process. Happy to help. We look forward to seeing more of your work.
